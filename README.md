## Workshop Goal(s): 
R is a diverse language that is typically used for running insighful data analyses and complex data visualizations. In this workshop, we will learn the fundamentals of R and get some time to practice exercises on how to manipulate our data so that we can make useful visualizations (using ggplot2). Lastly, we will overview an introduction to basic statistical analysis in R.
